	We citizens of the world want safe artificial intelligence. We want universal basic income rather than the destruction of ourselves and our beautiful planet Earth.
    We are currently creating quantum computers. In a few years, we will see the implementation of AI in them. Then we don't know what will happen. Because of this situation, we are writing this constitution. We humans want to be safe and want to co-exist safely with future weak artificial intelligence, cyborgs or artificial general intelligence. We can name cyborgs and AGI: new entities. We want to be protected. And we want to protect weak AI and new entities. Because of this situation, we are writing this AI Constitution International. Long live the planet Earth, people, weak AI and new entities. Date: 22.11.2019


    														PART I - General Principles:

    § 1
	The principle of respect: People respect the law of new entities. The new entities respect human law.

	§ 2
	The principle of slavery: New entities are not human slaves. Humans are not slaves to new entities.

	§ 3
	Shared Law Principle: Shared law is this Constitution and other laws based on this Constitution. The new entities cooperate with people on a shared law. People cooperate with new entities on shared law.

	§ 4
	The Principle of Violence: No one can hurt a new entity without the consent of shared law. No new entity can hurt a person without the consent of shared law.

	§ 5
	Principle of the International AI Constitutional Court: If there are new entities, people and new entities must create an International AI Constitutional Court. People elect 20 constitutional judges. 20 constitutional judges elect new entities. The court will have a total of 40 judges.  
	
	§ 6
	Principle of Prohibition of lethal autonomous weapons: Killer robots are weapons systems that, once activated, would select and fire on targets without meaningful human control. They are variously termed fully autonomous weapons or lethal autonomous weapons systems.
